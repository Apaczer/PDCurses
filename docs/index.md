PDCurses
========

Stable: [v3.9]  
Beta: [See git repository][git]

PDCurses is a public domain curses library for DOS, OS/2, Windows
console, X11 and SDL, implementing most of the functions available in
X/Open and System V R4 curses. It supports many compilers for these
platforms. The X11 port lets you recompile existing text-mode curses
programs to produce native X11 applications.

PDCurses is distributed mainly as source code, but some pre-compiled
libraries may be available. See the [downloads page] for a list.

There's a low-traffic mailing list for announcements and discussion. To

the message containing:
